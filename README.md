# tic-tac-toe

A milestone project in the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/ by Jose Portilla. Most code is written in Jupyter Notebook.

The first try file was my first try at constructing the game's functions and logic on my own without external help, this was to challenge myself and increase understanding.

The repetition files are my repetition of the material and had slight support since the base functions were created without any code inside. The difference between v1 and v2 is that version 1 contains some unnecessary code that i sorted out in version 2, however no drastic changes.
